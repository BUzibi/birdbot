Flappy bird implemented in Python

Open-source clone of the popular smartphone game Flappy Bird.

The project is implemented using pyglet. My goal in creating this was to build a platform for testing some Machine Learning algorithm(e.x. Reinforcement Learning). This project is just a game, not including the robot. I will create another project to train a flappy bird bot based on this.

There are still some parts need to refine(such as display score in a more pretty way, make the collision dectetion more precisely), but the game is mostly complete. You can clone it and have a try. Hope you have a fun. :)
